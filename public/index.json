[{"content":"Once upon a time, it was believed that there was a magic conch that was said to have possessed powers over the natural world and that it would grant various requests of its followers. A religion was established and, what would be later known as Conchism1, would take the world by storm. As time passed, many would fall away from Conchism. Some say it’s dead. However, whispers of a player harnessing similar powers to the Magic Conch have begun to surface.\nSo, what is Conchism? What does this mean for the new world? To begin, the Magic Conch is a deity that manifests itself primarily in a nautilus shell, but has also been known to manifest itself physically as fellow players. Conchism, established by Rage6838, is “a monotheistic religion based on the teachings of the Magic Conch…” At its core, Conchists, or followers of the Magic Conch, believed the following:\n Belief in the existence of the Magic Conch as a spiritual deity The omniscience and infallibility of the Magic Conch The Magic Conch’s ability to manifest itself in nautilus shells and certain animate beings Kipkemboi35 as the physical embodiment of the Conch  While there has been no signs of Kipkemboi35 or any other reincarnation of the Magic Conch today, rumors are spreading about an individual player harnessing the power of teleportation, producing blocks out of nothing, turning night to day in an instance, and more. Upon witnessing these miracles, this individual has amassed a following, with crowds chanting “RMC! RMC!” - whatever that means.\nWill this world experience a Magic Conch 2.0? What does it mean for the new world? Who is this mysterious magic wielder? Would you believe in a new Magic Conch?\n  Conchism - See https://newport.fandom.com/wiki/Conchism?so=search\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","permalink":"https://www.lorecraft.cc/news/opinion_is_conchism_really_dead/","summary":"Rumors of a great return.","title":"Is Conchism really dead"},{"content":"Hello everyone!\nWe want to genuinely thank everyone who\u0026rsquo;s put time and effort into the LoreCraft Server.

Hannah was a commoner of that king. She got pregnant at 20 with a daughter, who was later brought into this world named Dana. Her mother had to raise her alone while working multiple jobs barely able to put food on the table. Dana was little, but she could still see the sadness in her mother\u0026rsquo;s eyes.\nOne day, Dana applied to a knight school, two years passed and she was awarded the title of “Imperial Knight \u0026lsquo;\u0026rsquo;, as of her quick learning and the skill that she possessed. Dana was heading home and suddenly found knights standing in front of her home talking to her mother forcefully. Hannah started screaming for her to run. Dana was in a panic not knowing what to do, the knights chased Dana, but with her experience in combat and the skills she possessed, she took down all the knights with ease. Dana hid away with her mother, and filled with curiosity, Dana asked her mom what had happened. Hannah reveals that she and King Gennath had an affair and he never wanted anyone to know he had a child with a commoner.\nOnce the news about Dana reached the capital, the King went into a panic and ordered guards to execute Dana and her mother. Knowing this, Dana was filled with rage, the reason why her mother had to suffer alone was because of the King, which was the person she was trained to protect. The guards eventually found them, and while Dana was getting ready to prepare to fight, she was pushed into the river by her mother. She wanted Dana to live a normal and happy life.\nThe next day Dana’s mother was executed for a crime she did not commit, while Dana who was filled with anger and vengeance, ended up in The Commune. As the people saw the bounty for Dana, more and more started to hunt her down. Eventually they caught her, then set up an execution at noon. Dana was filled with anger but also sadness, losing her trust in people. As noon came and Dana was about to be beheaded by TheRecycler, but all the sudden out of nowhere a man in a black cape swooped in to save Dana.\nThe man later revealed his name to be Rhydian, a traveller who’s former kingdom had perished due to a volcano. The two set out to travel together, and eventually, the two fell in love on the road. Dana and Rhydian started developing the kingdom which we all know today as The Kingdom of Kintenko.\nDana later recruited a powerful organization as her special unit called “The Shadow Eminence”, which listens to her commands only, not only to protect her, should her father decide to one day come after her again, but also to bring peace and bring evil to justice.\n","permalink":"https://www.lorecraft.cc/news/expose_commune_forced_labor-copy/","summary":"This is the story of the rise of Queen Dana! a story about a poor child rising to be a Queen.","title":"The Rise of Kintenko Kingdom"},{"content":"I joined the commune hoping to find unity, peace and prosperity, and to learn what it truly means to be a part of this world. The commune sprang up and quickly became a true workhorse. A beautiful collaboration between individuals and their diverse talents, coming together to share resources of their own free will and selflessness. What a beautiful community to be a part of.\nAs I ventured out into the world, I discovered other players who had their own ideas about what prosperity looks like. Some decided to claim their own territory. Others decided to build kingdoms. Who was I to question their ways? Some met me with kindness and generosity, while others preferred to stay to themselves.\nThose who were kind to me stuck out. I recall a time I ventured into the Nether all by myself and was lost. A player, not of the commune, generously offered me leather enhanced boots to help me get around and was patient and kind as I learned my way to different portals. Another time, a player graciously offered me food when I was on the brink of death. This player was also not from the Commune. These players did so out of their acts of selflessness and the good of their own hearts. I would love to return the favor to them some day, not out of obligation, or because of fair trade: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a head for a head. No. I wish to pay them back because of their beautiful souls that reached out to me, and in ways that enhanced this temporary life of mine.\nI believe that a world like that is possible, regardless of how you choose to live and interact with others. Can it be possible?\nOn Thursday, my fellow Commune-ists disciplined one of members for inciting violence toward our neighbors. Will that be enough to help alleviate the anger and hate?

Of course, I am talking about the horrendous Resolution 4.\n\nThe resolution that you see an image of above was proposed by TheRecycler, a commune member. This resolution in and of itself shows a lack of caring of human life, and worse off, a lack of respect for players, period. This simply cannot stand in our server as of today.\nIn an effort to (1) organize the free states against the commune to be able to put up a resistance if necessary, and (2) to facilitate trade between the countries involved, I would like to propose to the states of LoreCraft that we join together, in an alliance group. Currently, I do not have a name for it, nor do I need to become the leader of the group. However, I believe this group to be necessary for our continued survival on the server.\nThis group\u0026rsquo;s main obligation would be to defend one another if we came under attack from the commune, or any other hostile force that appears on the server at any time. This improved security helps us to maintain our ways of life, as they currently stand, and we no longer have to worry about the sun being blotted out by communist arrows.\nThe group\u0026rsquo;s secondary obligation would be to facilitate trade between the country involved. This will end up being a little more difficult to get through, however I was seeing that we could all agree for a town or location in which we could build shoppes, farms, etc., and only allow the countrymen within the group to be able to come in and trade freely. This would not all be free, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know where this would be located, but that would be up for discussion.\nCurrently, this is just an idea in my head. However, I would like to see it come to a reality. Please, don\u0026rsquo;t let fear keep you from joining! We will be stronger together, and as we can see from Resolution 4, it looks like we may need that strength too, as the commune and their communists become more and more bloodthirsty, and continue to disregard human life.\nIf you are interested in joining, please DM @trailhopper27 via discord.

Finds Acts of Animal Cruelty and Forced Labor Camps.","title":"Commune is found to have forced labor and more"},{"content":" We were shocked and saddened to read a recent article by MrWeish, “The Communists Have Gone Too Far”, which makes a lot of inaccurate and misleading claims about the Commune. This article was not how we, the Commune, hoped to be introduced to the world. So we humbly ask you, reader, to let go of all your preconceived notions about the Commune and hear us out.\nBut first, allow me to introduce myself. My name is ratat0ing. I am a lifelong member of the Commune. The elevator pitch for our experimental community is that all property is shared by all members. We have one Central Storage building where all items are kept, free to use for all members. But the Commune is so much more than that. We all live by five Pillars, emphasizing values such as collectivism, shared property, democratic decision-making, equality, and mutual trust.\nMrWeish claims that “the Commune is a communist society built on the backs of the working class”. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of how our community works. In the Commune, there is no elite or working class, thanks to Pillar #4: “all members are equal in status and power”. We have no leaders. The thriving community you see today is the product of grassroots cooperation among equal members, not capitalistic greed or forced labor imposed by some imaginary elite.\nI’ll be the first to admit that I was originally skeptical about the Commune’s system. Wouldn’t collective property just encourage laziness and freeloading? But to my pleasant surprise, my concerns were proven wrong. When individuals are freed from the incentive of profit, the collective as a whole thrives. That’s why the Commune is the fastest-growing and most cohesive community in the world today. It has been a beautiful thing to watch unfold.\nBut this community can only thrive when individuals do not cheat the system. It’s why we have Pillar #5: “All members must act in good faith, with mutual trust and sincerity of intention, for the good of the Commune”. The instant one individual begins to act out of their own self-interest, the system breaks down. That’s why we in the Commune do not take kindly to outsiders reaping the rewards of the Commune without sowing. All members contribute, all members benefit.\nIn his recent article, MrWeish admits that he bought a diamond chestplate from one of the villagers owned by the Commune, without permission. He was then confronted by my comrades, TheRecycler and TheBeardedCleric. As punishment, MrWeish and my comrades agreed that MrWeish would return eight diamonds to the Commune and allow my comrades to execute him and take his head. The chat logs show that MrWeish agreed to these terms. It’s not like the Communers killed him without his permission.\nMrWeish argues that his purchase from the villager was not theft, since “the items offered by the villagers don’t belong to the Commune, they belong to the villagers. I didn’t steal the villagers from them.” In my mind, it doesn’t matter if the action was technically theft. At its core, it was an example of one individual benefitting from the work of the Commune without contributing work himself. If MrWeish had asked permission first, I’m sure that would have been a whole different story. The Commune has always been willing to share our spoils with outsiders.\nMrWeish, if you’re reading this, let us leave the past in the past and continue in peace. If you ever want to use the Commune’s resources, all you have to do is ask. Maybe someday, if you set aside your capitalistic ways, you can become a part of the beautiful experiment we call the Commune. That goes for everyone. If you want to be part of a vibrant community and never worry about putting food on the table again, we in the Commune welcome you with open arms.\n","permalink":"https://www.lorecraft.cc/news/opinion-give-the-commune-a-chance/","summary":"MrWeish wants you to believe that the Commune is the bad guy. Hear us out.","title":"Give the Commune a Chance"},{"content":"As many in the community may already know, I was recently executed by communists for trading with their villagers. My name is MrWeish, and I’ve only recently joined the server. I have been working hard to build a capitalist paradise on the mountains east of Spawn, which has put me on the border of the large community known as “The Commune”.\nThe Commune is a communist society built on the backs of the working class. They absolutely despise capitalists like me, who work hard for what we have. Since starting work on my settlement, I have been met with constant hostility from them. One could even say that they have been predisposed to hate me.\nWhile looking for an easier way to get diamond armor, I discovered their villager trading hall. There, I took my own goods and traded with the villagers for a diamond chestplate. I was quickly confronted by Commune members. Normally the Commune is supposed to vote on major decisions, but in my case, they simply declared me guilty on the spot for theft, no trial whatsoever. I had to pay them back for the chestplate with eight diamonds and was then executed so they could take my head and put it on a spike for the whole world to see. Not only was it humiliating, but it was completely undeserved.\nFor one, I didn’t break any rules. There was no official rule on the server against trading with someone else’s villagers. According to Rule 2 of the Base Rules for Lorecraft, stealing is defined as such: “taking or destroying another player’s private property (items, mobs, etc.) without their permission”. The items offered by the villagers don\u0026rsquo;t belong to the Commune, they belong to the villagers. I didn’t steal the villagers from them. I made a completely legitimate trade with a villager, an item for an item. The Commune came in as an illegal third party and intimidated me to give them payment they were NOT due.\nSince I’m a new player, I didn’t know the rules of the server very well. When the Commune members came to intimidate me, they convinced me that I had somehow broken a rule and that I had to pay up. They took advantage of me and continued to humiliate me by putting my head on a spike for the whole world to see. It goes without saying that I also lost many levels when they brutally executed me, just another punishment for a crime I didn’t commit.\nWith this all being said, it is my firm belief that I have been wronged, and that all players should beware of the Commune. The rapid armament of their members and the increasingly aggressive threats they type into chat have gotten out of hand. I may have been the first to fall victim to these communists, but I surely won’t be the last.\nI would like to finish by saying that, while this nasty business has certainly created tension, my businesses will still be open to all Commune members, including my planned state-of-the-art casino where guests can gamble to earn hundreds of diamonds and other high-value rewards. This and many more future businesses will soon be opened at the capitalist paradise, which I would like for everyone to consider as neutral ground where they can come to spend their hard-earned valuables. Together, we can build a brighter (and much wealthier) future.\n","permalink":"https://www.lorecraft.cc/news/opinion_the_communists_have_gone_too_far/","summary":"Opinion piece on why I was killed by communists, and why I don’t think it was justified.","title":"The Communists Have Gone Too Far"},{"content":"Do you enjoy writing?

The ultimate goal of this project is to allow Minecraft: Bedrock Edition users to join Minecraft: Java Edition servers as seamlessly as possible to allow for true cross-platform.\n While this is something that players won\u0026rsquo;t directly interface with, we decided to put this up for transparency. Geyser will only be noticable to players when it stops working, notably around version updates.

Once you claim land, that land is yours to use as you see fit. Below are some commands to help you get started with claiming an area:\n Move to a corner or point on the outside of the area that you want to claim Type /dmarker add corner Move to the next point on the outside of the area that you want to claim, making a straight line from the last corner Type /dmarker add corner again; this essentially draws a line between the first corner and this one. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have outlined your area After adding the last corner, type /dmarker addarea {label}, replacing the label with whatever you want to name the area  Congragulations! You have just claimed an area! This area now shows on the map. If you would like too (and we highly recommend that you do), change the outline color by doing /dmarker updatearea {label} color:#{RRGGBB}, or change the fill color with /dmarker updatearea {label} fillcolor:#{RRGGBB}. You can even change the opacity by doing /dmarker updatearea {label} fillopacity:{0.0-1.0}, where 0 is transparent and 1 is completely filled.\nYou can also add individual icons to the map as well. This could be for shops, or whatever you like! You can add a marker to the map by doing /dmarker addicon id:{ID} {label} icon:{icon}. The list of icons that you can choose from can be found below:\n Want to dive even deeper in Dynmap?

Each month, we require a certain amount of money from the community in order to operate the server. If the amount isn\u0026rsquo;t reached, the server could go down at the end of the billing cycle. Dontations are not expected, however they are apreciated and required to keep the server running!  There is only 1 more channel that I haven\u0026rsquo;t mentioned yet, as it is the next topic of conversation!\nGetting on the Whitelist The #get-whitelisted channel is specifically for getting your user account on the whitelist! We utilize a whitelist to limit individuals that are not a part of the server from joining, as well as using it to limit users from joining if there is an issue.\nDepending on which version of Minecraft you use, the process may be slightly different. Java users should send their minecraft username in the channel. For Bedrock users, connect first to the server at mcb.lorecraft.cc, and then when it says \u0026ldquo;Not whitelisted\u0026rdquo;, then send a message in the #get-whitelisted channel. This allows the server to know the bedrock user exists, and therefore can be whitelisted. If this is not completed, the whitelist may not work.\nWhile you\u0026rsquo;re waiting to be whitelisted, now would be a good time to continue reading the next 2 sections, the Rules and the Plugins!\nJoining the Game Once you\u0026rsquo;ve gotten on the whitelist, there\u0026rsquo;s not much else to do! You can join the server at either mc.lorecraft.cc for Java players, and mcb.lorecraft.cc for Bedrock players. If you have the time, we would highly recommend reading through the Rules on the rules page, where we outline the different plugins and rules that have been created by the rest of the players. I would also highly recommend going to the news section as well to learn about developments in the current world.\nWe hope you enjoy the game! We are so happy that you were able to join, and we can\u0026rsquo;t wait to see what you\u0026rsquo;ll create!\n","permalink":"https://www.lorecraft.cc/starting_out/","summary":"","title":"Quick Start"},{"content":"Layout of SWAG In order to propose and vote on Serverwide Association of Gamer (SWAG) resolutions, a player must be considered \u0026ldquo;active\u0026rdquo;. Active is defined as being online within 30 days from the proposition of a resolution. If a player is not active, they may not vote on or propose resolutions until they are active.\nVotes within SWAG Once a resolution is proposed, players will have 72 hours to cast their vote. Votes are cast by reacting with a 👍 or a 👎 reaction on the resolution. For resolutions not pertaining to SWAG or World Resets only require a simple majority of votes to pass (50% + 1). Resolutions that pertain to the system of SWAG or pertain to World Resets will require a 75% majority vote to pass. There is not a minimum amount of votes required on any resolution.\nProposing Resolutions \u0026amp; Discussions Discussions are to take place in the tread below the resolution post. All resolutions should be formatted with title containing \u0026ldquo;Resolution N\u0026rdquo;. If the proposal is a world reset, the proposal should be titled \u0026ldquo;World Reset M\u0026rdquo;, notably being a different counter specific to world resets.\nIf a Resolution is proposed, and then must be changed, it can be edited. When you go to edit it, the following items need to be changed:\nPer Resolution 5, SWAG resolutions may no longer be edited. If you would like to edit a resolution, a similar solution is to apply the \u0026ldquo;voided\u0026rdquo; tag, and then propose the same resolution with a new number. The voided resolution will be closed and locked.\nFurther questions If you have more questions as they pertain to SWAG, please reach out to one of the admins in the general chat, or feel free to DM them.\n","permalink":"https://www.lorecraft.cc/rules/swag-guidelines/","summary":"Guidelines for utilizing SWAG","title":"SWAG Utilization"}]
