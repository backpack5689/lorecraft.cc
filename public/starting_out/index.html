We are so excited to have you joining our server!\nThe goal of this guide is to be a one-stop-shop for how to interact with the server, and how to get started in the world! Due to the amount of world building, and the massive amount of players able to join, our admin team has developed this guide to help you quickly get into the game!\nThere are 4 steps that we are going to go through today, that when completed, you should be completely ready to join! Feel free to click on any of the items below to jump to that section.\nJoining the Discord Getting on the Whitelist Reading the Rules Understanding the Plugins Let’s jump into those now!\nJoining the Discord Discord is one of the central places that the world building and community of our server can be seen. Members have the ability to communicate together and plan events, all from the server! It also houses the main mechanism to making changes to the server - SWAG - which we will discuss later.\nTo begin with, click this link to join the discord server. If you do not already have a discord account, you can create one at this link. In case you are brand new to discord, here is a video outlining the basics of discord in 148,000 milliseconds or less.\nNow that we have an understanding of how to interact with Discord, how does LoreCraft work? There are a couple channels that should be findable at all times. Here’s a list of them!\n#welcome - A channel for all the system messages. Any new users that join will have a message here notifying the rest of the server #links - This channel is all the links that a user may need for the server. It contains links to maps, important plugins, and other such items! #system-notifications - Are you having an issue with the server? There may be a message about that in this channel! It mainly pertains to the systems that Lorecraft hosts, so the map, server itself, or the webpage #announcements - This is the server that admins will use to communicate changes or poll users. #funding - Our minecraft server is crowd funded. Each month, we require a certain amount of money from the community in order to operate the server. If the amount isn’t reached, the server could go down at the end of the billing cycle. Dontations are not expected, however they are apreciated and required to keep the server running! There is only 1 more channel that I haven’t mentioned yet, as it is the next topic of conversation!\nGetting on the Whitelist The #get-whitelisted channel is specifically for getting your user account on the whitelist! We utilize a whitelist to limit individuals that are not a part of the server from joining, as well as using it to limit users from joining if there is an issue.\nDepending on which version of Minecraft you use, the process may be slightly different. Java users should send their minecraft username in the channel. For Bedrock users, connect first to the server at mcb.lorecraft.cc, and then when it says “Not whitelisted”, then send a message in the #get-whitelisted channel. This allows the server to know the bedrock user exists, and therefore can be whitelisted. If this is not completed, the whitelist may not work.\nWhile you’re waiting to be whitelisted, now would be a good time to continue reading the next 2 sections, the Rules and the Plugins!\nReading the Rules Understanding the Plugins ","wordCount":"597","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Server Admins"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://piko-heksagon.netlify.app/starting_out/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Lorecraft","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://piko-heksagon.netlify.app/uploads/Lorecraft_Discord_Icon.jpg"}}}</script></head><body><nav class=desktop><ul><li><a class=logo href=https://piko-heksagon.netlify.app/ accesskey=h title="Welcome to Lorecraft!
